# Headless-Droid-Engine
Prototyping rendering framework served as a playground for my experiments

## Disclamer
* HDE will be in a development state (aka Not Completed) for a long time.
* HDE will be frequently refactored with API breaking changes here and there.

## Goals
* Layered architecture
* Custom allocators for memory management
* No STL
* Windows only
* Vulkan + DX12
* Heterogeneous Multi-GPU
* Render graph
* Minimal dependencies
* C++17
